  abstract = {Stable dominance hierarchies may form for a variety of reasons. Assessment of the probable outcome of future encounters is likely to be the best way of economizing energy and risk of injury. Where assessment involves taking into account physical or behavioural characteristics of opponents, an arms race will develop between genuinely high status individuals and cheats possessing high status cues. Successive addition of reference cues may result ending either in a complex series of assessment cues or in cues which are status-limited. No distinction can be drawn between assessment involving so-called individual recognition and that involving ``simpler'' cues.},

Instead, they commonly use a decision-theoretic measure of the value of information, on the grounds that Shannon's measure draws no distinction between useful and useless information. Here we show that these two measures are intimately related in the context of biological evolution. We present a simple model of evolution in an uncertain environment, and calculate the increase in Darwinian fitness that is made possible by information about the environmental state. This fitness increase - the fitness value of information - is a composite of both the Shannon entropy and the decision-theoretic measure of information value. Furthermore, the Shannon entropy of the environment, which seemingly fails to take anything about Darwinian fitness into account, nonetheless imposes an upper bound on the fitness value of information.},

Maynard Smith (1991) and Johnstone and Grafen (1992) introduce the Sir Philip Sidney game in order to extend the handicap principle to interactions among related individuals, and to demonstrate that stable costly signalling systems can exist among relatives.In this paper we demonstrate that despite the benefits associated with honest information transfer, the costs incurred in a stable costly signalling system may leave all participants worse off than they would be in a system with no signalling at all. In both the discrete and continuous forms of the Sir Philip Sidney game, there exist conditions under which costly signalling among relatives, while stable, is so costly that it is disadvantageous compared with no signalling at all. We determine the factors which dictate signal cost and signal benefit in a generalized version of this game, and explain how signal cost can exceed signal value. Such results raise concerns about theevolutionary pathways which could have led to the existence of signalling equilibria in nature. The paper stresses the importance of comparing signalling equilibria with other possible strategies, beforedrawing conclusions regarding the optimality of signalling.},

  abstract = {Animal communication continues to be one of the most active and popular topics in behavioral ecology, neurobiology, and evolutionary biology. An enormous amount of relevant new research has been published since the first edition of Principles of Animal Communication, and over 90\% of the citations in this new edition were published since the first edition appeared.Although the basic order of topics is similar, this second edition is a completely new book. The topics in the 26 chapters of the first edition have been condensed and integrated into 16 chapters in the new version so as to better accommodate upper-division undergraduate courses with 15-week semesters. The text omits boxes and, instead, the relevant mathematics, more advanced considerations, citation bibliographies, and web links for topic enrichment have been assembled into chapter-specific and freely accessible web modules. This was done to improve the flow for undergraduates, while still providing access to more technical details and scholarly sources for graduate courses and professional users. Figures and photos are now full-color and the book has a larger format that makes for easier reading. This edition retains the broad taxonomic and sensory scope of the first edition and even adds coverage of several modalities and taxa not discussed in the first edition. As with the first edition, every chapter concludes with an itemized summary of major points and suggestions for additional reading.As the title suggests, the emphasis in the text is on identifying general principles that apply broadly across taxa and modalities. At the same time, major effort has been expended to integrate these principles with the accepted principles of economics and other fields of science. Given this integrative nature, animal communication is a topic that can serve both as an appealing entry point to science for younger students and as a coalescing of separate disciplines for more senior ones.For StudentsCompanion WebsiteNew for the second edition, the Principles of Animal Communication Companion Website is freely accessible to all students and includes:* Chapter Outlines for a quick overview of each chapter.* Chapter Summaries for review of each chapter's main concepts.* Web Topics that provide additional coverage and background material on a variety of topics throughout the textbook.* Literature Cited for all works cited in the textbook. For Instructors (Available to Qualified Adopters)Instructor's Resource LibraryThe new Instructor's Resource Library disc includes all of the textbook's figures and tables (including photos) as both high- and low-resolution JPEG images, formatted and optimized for projection.

In some species, individuals use colour patterns to signal their social status. Recent studies claimed that facial markings in the eusocial paper wasp Polistes dominulus are status badges that allow co-foundresses to form a linear hierarchy based on individual quality. Here, we evaluated facial patterns in natural populations of P. dominulus, in its native range, to observe whether the marks reflect overall wasp quality in different contexts. We used the same measures of clypeus patterns used by earlier studies, but did not find that they functioned as status badges. Our analyses showed no evidence that visual markers are related to: (i) size, (ii) probability of surviving winter, (iii) social rank in spring associations, or (iv) health status (assessed by the presence of strepsipteran endoparasites). Size, however, is important. Larger wasps are more likely to survive the winter and to acquire the dominant position in spring associations. Larvae infected with endoparasites become smaller adult wasps. These findings suggest that body size is a reliable quality indicator on which wasps build their social networks, and that clypeus patterning is not involved.},

We manipulated plumage in golden-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia atricapilla) and found that two known badges of status \textendash{} gold and black head plumage patch sizes \textendash{} independently affect dominance among strangers but manipulations had no effect on dominance among familiar flockmates. Moreover, familiar flockmates showed less aggression and increased foraging relative to strangers.

Thus, they are excellent for studying trait evolution in a phylogenetic framework. We examined lability versus conservatism in morphological and behavioral traits in two related clades of sparrows (Aimophila, Peucaea), and assessed whether habitat has played an important role in trait evolution. We first inferred a multi-locus phylogeny which we used to reconstruct ancestral states, and then quantified phylogenetic signal among morphological and behavioral traits in these clades and in New World sparrows more broadly. Behavioral traits have a stronger phylogenetic signal than morphological traits. Specifically, vocal duets and song structure are the most highly conserved traits, and nesting behavior appears to be maintained within clades. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between open habitat and unpatterned plumage, complex song, and ground nesting. However, even within lineages that share the same habitat type, species vary in nesting, plumage pattern, song complexity, and duetting. Our findings highlight trade-offs between behavior, morphology, and ecology in sparrow diversification.},

Traits signaling identity should be highly variable, often display polymodal distributions, not be condition dependent (i.e., be cheap to produce and/or maintain), not be associated with fitness differences, exhibit independent assortment of component characters, and often occur as fixed phenotypes with a high degree of genetic determination. We illustrate the existence of traits with precisely these attributes in the ornamental, conspicuously variable, and sexually dimorphic breeding plumages of ruff sandpipers Philomachus pugnax and red-billed queleas Quelea quelea. Although ruffs lek and queleas are monogamous, both species breed in high-density aggregations with high rates of social interactions (e.g., aggression and territory defense). Under these socioecological conditions, individual recognition based on visual cues may be unusually important. In contrast to these species, we also review plumage characteristics in house finches Carpodacus mexicanus, a nonterritorial, dispersed-breeding species in which plumage ornamentation is thought to signal quality. In keeping with expectations for quality signals, house finch plumage is relatively less variable, unimodally distributed, condition dependent, correlated with fitness measures, has positively correlated component characters, and is a plastic, environmentally determined trait. We briefly discuss signals of identity in other animals.},

Thus, it is argued, honest assessment will be replaced by conventional signalling. Conventional signals are open to cheating, but cheating will be kept at low frequencies by the frequency-dependent benefits of occasional assessment (or `probing'), so dishonest signalling remains stable.

It has been shown to be the basic mechanism for sympatric and parapatric speciation, despite the essential asexual nature of AD. After 20 years from its introduction, we unfold the transition from evolutionary stability (ESS) to branching, along with gradual change in environmental, control, or exploitation parameters. The transition is a catastrophic evolutionary shift, the branching dynamics driving the system to a nonlocal evolutionary attractor that is viable before the transition, but unreachable from the ESS. Weak evolutionary stability hence qualifies as an early-warning signal for branching and a testable measure of the community's resilience against biodiversity. We clarify a controversial theoretical question about the smoothness of the mutant invasion fitness at incipient branching. While a supposed nonsmoothness at third order long prevented the analysis of the ESS-branching transition, we argue that smoothness is generally expected and derive a local canonical model in terms of the geometry of the invasion fitness before branching. Any generic AD model undergoing the transition qualitatively behaves like our canonical model.},

According to previous research, 2 conditions are necessary for learning to be adaptive: between-generation environmental variability and within-generation environmental predictability. In this article, we show that between-generation variability is not necessary and that instrumental learning can provide a selective advantage in a complex environment, where an individual is exposed to a large number of different challenges during its lifespan. We construct an evolutionary model where individuals have a memory with limited storage capacity, and an evolving trait determines the fraction of that memory that should be allocated to innate responses to the environment versus learning these responses. The evolutionarily stable level of learning depends critically on the features of the environmental process, but generally increases with environmental complexity. We conclude by emphasizing that the specific advantages of learning should be distinguished from the general advantages of phenotypic plasticity, and we discuss possible routes to empirically test our claims.},

  abstract = {Behavioral ecologists have long been comfortable assuming that genetic architecture does not constrain which phenotypescan evolve (the ``phenotypic gambit''). For flexible behavioral traits, however, solutions to adaptive problems are reached not only by genetic evolution but also by behavioral changes within an individual's lifetime, via psychological mechanisms such as learning. Standard optimality approaches ignore these mechanisms, implicitly assuming that they do not constrain the expression of adaptive behavior. This assumption, which we dub the behavioral gambit, is sometimes wrong: evolved psychological mechanisms can prevent animals from behaving optimally in specific situations. To understand the functional basis of behavior, we would do better by considering the underlying mechanisms, rather than the behavioral outcomes they produce, as the target of selection. This change of focus yields new, testable predictions about evolutionary equilibria, the development of behavior, and the properties of cognitive systems. Studies on the evolution of learning rules hint at the potential insights to be gained, but such mechanism-based approaches are underexploited. We highlight three future research priorities: (1) systematic theoretical analysis of the evolutionary properties of learning rules; (2) detailed empirical study of how animals learn in nonforaging contexts;and (3) analysis of individual differences in learning rules and their associated fitness consequences.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on the division of labor between evolution and development in solving sequential, state-dependent decision problems. Currently, behavioral ecologists tend to use dynamic programming methods to study such problems. These methods are successful at predicting animal behavior in a variety of contexts. However, they depend on a distinct set of assumptions. Here, we argue that behavioral ecology will benefit from drawing more than it currently does on a complementary collection of tools, called reinforcement learning methods. These methods allow for the study of behavior in highly complex environments, which conventional dynamic programming methods do not feasibly address. In addition, reinforcement learning methods are well-suited to studying how biological mechanisms solve developmental and learning problems. For instance, we can use them to study simple rules that perform well in complex environments. Or to investigate under what conditions natural selection favors fixed, non-plastic traits (which do not vary across individuals), cue-driven-switch plasticity (innate instructions for adaptive behavioral development based on experience), or developmental selection (the incremental acquisition of adaptive behavior based on experience). If natural selection favors developmental selection, which includes learning from environmental feedback, we can also make predictions about the design of reward systems. Our paper is written in an accessible manner and for a broad audience, though we believe some novel insights can be drawn from our discussion. We hope our paper will help advance the emerging bridge connecting the fields of behavioral ecology and reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {We present a new mathematical formulation of associative learning focused on non-human animals, which we call A-learning. Building on current animal learning theory and machine learning, A-learning is composed of two learning equations, one for stimulus-response values and one for stimulus values (conditioned reinforcement). A third equation implements decision-making by mapping stimulus-response values to response probabilities. We show that A-learning can reproduce the main features of: instrumental acquisition, including the effects of signaled and unsignaled non-contingent reinforcement; Pavlovian acquisition, including higher-order conditioning, omission training, autoshaping, and differences in form between conditioned and unconditioned responses; acquisition of avoidance responses; acquisition and extinction of instrumental chains and Pavlovian higher-order conditioning; Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer; Pavlovian and instrumental outcome revaluation effects, including insight into why these effects vary greatly with training procedures and with the proximity of a response to the reinforcer. We discuss the differences between current theory and A-learning, such as its lack of stimulus-stimulus and response-stimulus associations, and compare A-learning with other temporal-difference models from machine learning, such as Q-learning, SARSA, and the actor-critic model. We conclude that A-learning may offer a more convenient view of associative learning than current mathematical models, and point out areas that need further development.},

Zahavi's major claims for the handicap principle are thus vindicated. The place of cheating is discussed in view of the honesty that follows from the handicap principle. Parallel signalling models in economics are discussed. Interpretations of the handicap principle are compared.

  abstract = {Despite decades of interest, the adaptive significance of the extraordinary diversity in the design of animal signals remains elusive. It is suggested that signal design consists of two components: `strategic design' and `efficacy'. Strategic design is concerned with how a signal is constructed by natural selection to provide the information necessary to make a receiver respond (e.g. by being good at displaying underlying quality), whilst efficacy is concerned with how a signal is designed to get that information across to the receiver (e.g. by being easily measured). It is argued that an important but neglected evolutionary force on animal signals is therefore the psychology of the signal receiver, and that three aspects of receiver psychology (what a receiver finds easy to detect, easy to discriminate and easy to remember) constitute powerful selective forces in signal design. Greatest emphasis is given to memorability because this has been least considered by previous authors. It is argued that learning and memory are involved in a wide range of signals, and numerous hypotheses as to how signals may be adapted to be more memorable to receivers are suggested. The relationship of this analysis to earlier attempts at understanding signals is explored, particularly with reference to the concepts of honesty, manipulation and mind-reading.},

While the use of game-theoretic equilibrium analysis in such models is often justified by some intuitive dynamic argument, the formal analysis of evolutionary dynamics in costly-signaling games has only recently gained more attention. In this paper, we study evolutionary dynamics in two basic classes of games with two states of nature, two signals, and two possible reactions in response to signals: a discrete version of Spence's (1973) model and a discrete version of Grafen's (1990) formalization of the handicap principle. We first use index theory to give a rough account of the dynamic stability properties of the equilibria in these games. Then, we study in more detail the replicator dynamics and to some extent the best-response dynamics. We relate our findings to equilibrium analysis based on classical, rationality-oriented methods of equilibrium refinement in signaling games.},

Males for which the first contest was signaled not only were more likely to defeat their rivals than control males but, having won that encounter, they also were more likely to win a second contest than fish that had lost their first encounter.

At the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), either a proportionp* of animals always play Hawk, or each animal has a probabilityp* of playing Hawk. We modify the standard Hawk-Dove game to include a state variable,x, that represents the animal's level of energy reserves. A strategy is now a rule for choosing an action as a function ofx and time of day. We consider a non-reproductive period and adopt the criterion of minimizing mortality over this period. We find the ESS, which has the form `play Hawk if reserves are belowc* (t) at timet, otherwise play Dove'. This ESS is very different from the ESS in the standard Hawk-Dove game. It is a pure ESS that depends on the animal's state and on time. Furthermore, it is characterized by the strong condition that any single mutant that does not adopt the ESS suffers a reduction in fitness. The standard Hawk-Dove game assumes pay-offs that are related to fitness; our approach starts from a definition of fitness and derives the pay-offs in the process of finding the ESS. When the environment becomes worse (e.g. food becomes less reliable or energy expenditure increases) the ESS changes in such a way as to increase the proportion of animals that will play Hawk.},

He has also been the major influence on the direction of this field, which now pervades behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology. In its original formulation the theory had three components: a set of strategies, a payoff structure, and a concept of evolutionary stability. These three key components are still the basis of the theory, but what is assumed about each component is often different to the original assumptions. We review modern approaches to these components. We emphasis that if a game is considered in isolation, and arbitrary payoffs are assumed, then the payoffs may not be consistent with other components of the system which are not modelled. Modelling the whole system, including not only the focal game, but also the future behaviour of the players and the behaviour of other population members, allows a consistent model to be constructed. We illustrate this in the case of two models of parental care, showing how linking a focal game to other aspects of the system alters what is predicted.},

Analysis of a simple ESS model reveals that this is only possible if aggressive individuals incur a cost independent of any particular fights they become involved in. Without such a cost, an honest population is vulnerable to invasion by a ``modest'' mutant bearing a dishonestly small badge. Analysis of a second model reveals that where individuals differ in their ability to bear the contest-independent cost of aggressiveness, badge size should reflect this ability. Under such circumstances, plumage badges which serve as honest status signals may have functional consequences beyond their role in settling contests. Thus females, when choosing a mate, could make good use of the information that plumage badges provide. Analysis of a third model shows that the existence of contest-independent benefits to badge size, such as increased mating success, is compatible with the maintenance of honest status signalling.},

In contexts ranging from courtship and mating to parent-offspring communication to predator deterrence, biological signals often involve a number of different visual, auditory and/or olfactory components. Previous models of communication have tended to ignore this complexity, assuming that only one kind of display is available. Here, a new game-theoretical model of signalling is described, in which signallers may use more than one display to advertise their qualities. Additional displays may serve to enhance the accuracy with which receivers assess a single quality (the `backup signal' hypothesis), or to provide information about different qualities (the `multiple message' hypothesis). Multiple signals are shown to be stable, even when multiple receiver preferences entail significant costs, provided that signalling costs are strongly accelerating. In such cases, signallers bias their investment towards more efficient forms of signal, but not to the exclusion of other display types. When costs are not strongly accelerating, by contrast, individual signallers employ only a single display at equilibrium. If different signals provide information about different qualities, however, then the equilibrium may feature alternative signalling strategies, with signallers who excel in one quality employing one kind of display, and those who excel in another quality employing another kind.},

The model assumes that the receiver may respond favourably or unfavourably to the signaller, but that it cannot immediately determine which type of response is appropriate. The signaller, who always benefits by eliciting a favourable response (but is unaware of which type of response is appropriate for the receiver), may choose to reveal or conceal its identity, making the task of discrimination easier or harder for the receiver. The evolutionarily stable outcome of the model depends on the probability that an unfavourable response is appropriate, the relative costs to the receiver of acceptance and rejection errors, and the relative benefits to the signaller of eliciting a favourable response when this is appropriate and when it is inappropriate for the receiver. High costs of acceptance errors to the receiver, and high benefits of appropriate favourable responses to the signaller, favour provision of distinctive identity cues: so, paradoxically, does a high probability that an unfavourable response is appropriate. However, under a wide range of conditions, selection favours the withholding of signature cues, which prevents discrimination by the receiver. Finally, if the signaller must provide some information to elicit a favourable response, but stands to gain more from such a response when it is undesirable, it may do best to provide partial but incomplete information about its identity.},

We illustrate this principle by constructing examples of cost-free signaling equilibria for the two paradigmatic signaling games of Grafen (1990) and Godfray (1991). Our findings may explain why some animal signals use cost to ensure honesty whereas others do not and suggest that empirical tests of the signaling hypothesis should focus not on equilibrium cost but, rather, on the cost of deviation from equilibrium. We use these results to apply costly signaling theory to the low-cost signals that make up human language. Recent game theoretic models have shown that several key features of language could plausibly arise and be maintained by natural selection when individuals have coincident interests. In real societies, however, individuals do not have fully coincident interests. We show that coincident interests are not a prerequisite for linguistic communication, and find that many of the results derived previously can be expected also under more realistic models of society.},

These models have focused primarily on a single type of honest signalling equilibrium, theseparatingequilibrium in which any two different signallers send distinct signals, thereby providing signal receivers with complete information. In this paper, we demonstrate that in signalling among relatives (modelled using the Sir Philip Sidney game), there is not one but a large number of possible signalling equilibria, most of which arepoolingequilibria in which different types of signallers may share a common signal. We prove that in a general Sir Philip Sidney game, any partition of signallers into equi-signalling classes can have a stable signalling equilibrium if and only if it is a contiguous partition, and provide examples of such partitions. A similar (but slightly stricter) condition is shown to hold when signals are transmitted through a medium with signalling error. These results suggest a solution to a problem faced by previous signalling theory models: when we consider the separating equilibrium, signal cost is independent of the frequency of individuals sending that signal and, consequently, even very rare signaller types can drastically affect signal cost. Here, we show that by allowing these rare signallers to pool with more common signallers, signal cost can be greatly reduced.},

  abstract = {In social interactions, including cooperation and conflict, individuals can adjust their behaviour over the shorter term through learning within a generation, and natural selection can change behaviour over the longer term of many generations. Here we investigate the evolution of cognitive bias by individuals investing into a project that delivers joint benefits. For members of a group that learn how much to invest using the costs and benefits they experience in repeated interactions, we show that overestimation of the cost of investing can evolve. The bias causes individuals to invest less into the project. Our explanation is that learning responds to immediate rather than longer-term rewards. There are thus cognitive limitations in learning, which can be seen as bounded rationality. Over a time horizon of several rounds of interaction, individuals respond to each other's investments, for instance by partially compensating for another's shortfall. However, learning individuals fail to strategically take into account that social partners respond in this way. Learning instead converges to a one-shot Nash equilibrium of a game with perceived rewards as payoffs. Evolution of bias can then compensate for the cognitive limitations of learning.},

It is concluded that contests will be settled by non-costly traits only if the value of the contested resource is small relative to the cost of fighting, and that `honest' signalling of aggressiveness is stable only if individuals giving signals that are inconsistent with their behaviour suffer costs. The literature on `badges of dominance' in birds is reviewed. New data on great tits, greenfinches and corn buntings show that there is plumage variability within age and sex that sometimes serves to settle contests, and that, in the first two species but not the third, the badges are uncorrelated with size, and settle contests only over trivial resources.},

However, progress has been limited thus far due to differences in approaches between psychologists and behavioral ecologists. Although the former tend to use controlled experiments to pinpoint precise cognitive mechanisms, these experiments often lack ecological validity. In contrast, behavioral ecologists seek to understand the adaptive function of cooperative behavior of animals in the wild but typically neglect the underlying psychological mechanisms. Here we appraise and integrate evidence from these two approaches to understand the potential cognitive solutions to four fundamental challenges that animals face during cooperative interactions under natural conditions: (1) when to cooperate; (2) with whom to cooperate; (3) what to do in cooperative interactions; (4) how much to contribute to cooperation. We argue that an ecologically motivated approach is critical to understanding the psychological mechanisms of cooperation and how these mechanisms evolve.},

We investigate the evolutionarily stable strategies in the contest. Rather than assuming a set of costs and benefits, we suppose that the animals return to a background foraging process after the contest. This approach allows us to derive the costs and benefits directly in terms of the animal's expected future reproductive success. In a state-dependent version of the Hawk-Dove game, animals should play Hawk if their reserves are low and play Dove if their reserves are high. In a state-dependent version of the War of Attrition game, the situation is less clear. This is because although both the value of a food item and the cost of wasting time change with reserves, they remain roughly proportional to one another. When these benefits and costs are exactly proportional to one another we show that there is no evolutionarily stable strategy, and that the obvious negative exponential strategy can be invaded by two classes of policy. In one class, animals become more persistent as the value of food increases; in the other class animals become less persistent as the value of food increases. In both cases the mutant policy invades because although it does badly against the resident population when rewards and costs are low, it does well against the resident population when rewards and costs are high.},

In particular, when analysing the evolution of cooperation it is often implicitly assumed that ignoring variation will produce predictions that approximate the solution when differences are included. This need not be true. As we demonstrate, differences are not innocuous noise, but can fundamentally change the nature of a game. Even small amounts of variability can stabilize cooperation by, for example, maintaining the need to deal with cheaters. Differences promote the need to learn about others in an interaction, leading to contingent behaviour that can reduce conflict, and to negotiated outcomes that may or may not be more cooperative than unconditional actions. Once there are mechanisms such as mutation and environmental influences that maintain variation within populations, whether cooperation evolves may depend on the variation in the cooperativeness trait. Variation means that it may be worth taking a chance that a partner is cooperative by being cooperative. When there are markets, so that individuals can break off interactions to seek a better partner, variation promotes choosiness and hence penalizes those uncooperative individuals, who are rejected. Variation promotes the need to monitor the previous behaviour of others, and once this social sensitivity exists, the need to maintain a good reputation can promote cooperation.},

In such cases female reproductive success should be positively related to body condition6 and a heritable component of the time of breeding should be affected by stabilizing selection7. Female preferences for orna-mented males would be favoured by sexual selection because such choosy females would have a greater probability of bearing orna-mented sons with an increased chance of pairing up early. I report here that in the monogamous swallow, Hirundo rustica, males with experimentally elpngated tail ornaments obtain mates more quickly than males with shorter tails, and enjoy increased reproductive output in one breeding season.

  abstract = {The view is examined that the adaptive value of conventional aspects of fighting behaviour is for assessment of relative RHP (resource holding power) of the combatants. Outcomes of aggressive disputes should be decided by each individual's fitness budget available for expenditure during a fight (determined by the fitness difference between adoption of alternative strategies, escalation or withdrawal without escalation) and on the rate of expenditure of the fitness budget if escalation occurs (determined by the RHPs of the combatants). Thus response thresholds for alternative strategies (``assessments'') will be determined by natural selection on a basis of which opponent is likely to expend its fitness budget first, should escalation occur. This ``loser'' should retreat (before escalation) and the winner should stay in possession of the resource. Many aggressive decisions depend on whether one is a resource holder, or an attacker. Assuming the RHP of the combatants to be equal, there are many instances of fitness pay-off imbalances between holder and attacker which should weight the dispute outcome in favour of one or other opponent by allowing it a greater expendable fitness budget. Usually the weighting favours the holder; the attacker therefore needs a correspondingly higher RHP before it may be expected to win. This is not invariably the case, and much observed data fits the predictions of this sort of model. If assessments are perfect and budget expenditure rates exactly predictable, then there would never seem to be any case for escalation. Escalation can be explained in terms of injury inflictions (expenditures) occurring as discrete events; i.e. as ``bouts'' won or lost during fighting. Assessment can give only a probabilistic prediction of the outcome of a bout. A simple model is developed to investigate escalation situations. Each combatant assesses relative RHP; this correlates with an absolute probability of winning the next bout (cabs). The stake played for is infliction of loss of RHP and is determined by the fitness budgets of the opponents. (Each individual plays for the withdrawal of its opponent.) This defines a critical probability of winning (ccrit) for each combatant, above which escalation is the favourable strategy (cabs {$>$} ccrit) and below which withdrawal is favourable (cabs {$<$} ccrit). Escalation should occur only where cabs-ccrit is positive for both combatants. This model gives predictions compatible with the observations, indicating that RHP loss alone can be adequate to explain withdrawal: escalation behaviour. Withdrawal tendency will be increased by low searching costs. Escalations should be restricted to closely matched RHP opponents if RHP disparity is the major imbalance. Outside the ``escalation range'' of a given individual, the higher RHP individual wins and the lower one loses (i.e. it should withdraw after conventional display). RHP disparity and holder: attacker imbalance should both interact to shape the observed pattern, though their relative importances will depend on species and situation. In some instances selection may favour immediate withdrawal from an occupied territory even without assessment of RHP.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The most widely cited explanation for the evolution of reliable signals is Zahavi's so-called Handicap Principle, which proposes that signals are honest because they are costly to produce. Here we provide a critical review of the Handicap Principle and its theoretical development. We explain why this idea is erroneous, and how it nevertheless became widely accepted as the leading explanation for honest signalling. In 1975, Zahavi proposed that elaborate secondary sexual characters impose ?handicaps? on male survival, not due to inadvertent signalling trade-offs, but as a mechanism that functions to demonstrate males' genetic quality to potential mates. His handicap hypothesis received many criticisms, and in response, Zahavi clarified his hypothesis and explained that it assumes that signals are wasteful as well as costly, and that they evolve because wastefulness enforces honesty. He proposed that signals evolve under ?signal selection?, a non-Darwinian type of selection that favours waste rather than efficiency. He maintained that the handicap hypothesis provides a general principle to explain the evolution of all types of signalling systems, i.e. the Handicap Principle. In 1977, Zahavi proposed a second hypothesis for honest signalling, which received many different labels and interpretations, although it was assumed to be another example of handicap signalling. In 1990, Grafen published models that he claimed vindicated Zahavi's Handicap Principle. His conclusions were widely accepted and the Handicap Principle subsequently became the dominant paradigm for explaining the evolution of honest signalling in the biological and social sciences. Researchers have subsequently focused on testing predications of the Handicap Principle, such as measuring the absolute costs of honest signals (and using energetic and other proximate costs as proxies for fitness), but very few have attempted to test Grafen's models. We show that Grafen's models do not support the handicap hypothesis, although they do support Zahavi's second hypothesis, which proposes that males adjust their investment into the expression of their sexual signals according to their condition and ability to bear the costs (and risks to their survival). Rather than being wasteful over-investments, honest signals evolve in this scenario because selection favours efficient and optimal investment into signal expression and minimizes signalling costs. This idea is very different from the handicap hypothesis, but it has been widely misinterpreted and equated to the Handicap Principle. Theoretical studies have since shown that signalling costs paid at the equilibrium are neither sufficient nor necessary to maintain signal honesty, and that honesty can evolve through differential benefits, as well as differential costs. There have been increasing criticisms of the Handicap Principle, but they have focused on the limitations of Grafen's model and overlooked the fact that it is not a handicap model. This model is better understood within a Darwinian framework of adaptive signalling trade-offs, without the added burden and confusing logic of the Handicap Principle. There is no theoretical or empirical support for the Handicap Principle and the time is long overdue to usher this idea into an ?honorable retirement?.},

Being individually discriminated is more difficult in larger groups, and large group size may select for increased individuality\textendash signature information\textendash in social signals, to facilitate discrimination [4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Small-scale studies suggest that more social species have greater individuality in their social signals, such as contact calls [4, 12, 13]. However, this relationship has not been evaluated in a broader-scale evolutionary context or in social signals other than contact calls. It is not yet known whether social group size may be viewed as a general evolutionary driver of individuality. Here we show a strong positive evolutionary link between social group size in sciurid rodents and individuality in their social alarm calls. Social group size explained over 88\% of the variation in vocal individuality in phylogenetic independent contrasts. Species living in larger groups, but not in more complex groups, had more signature information in their calls. Our results suggest that social group size may promote the evolution of individual signatures and that the sociality-individuality relationship may be~a general phenomenon in nature.},

  abstract = {Two alternative frameworks explain the evolution of cooperation in the face of conflicting interests. Conflicts can be alleviated by kinship, the alignment of interests by virtue of shared genes, or by negotiation strategies, allowing mutually beneficial trading of services or commodities. Although negotiation often occurs in kin-structured populations, the interplay of kin- and negotiation-based mechanisms in the evolution of cooperation remains an unresolved issue. Inspired by the biology of a cooperatively breeding fish, we developed an individual-based simulation model to study the evolution of negotiation-based cooperation in relation to different levels of genetic relatedness. We show that the evolution of negotiation strategies leads to an equilibrium where subordinates appease dominants by conditional cooperation, resulting in high levels of help and low levels of aggression. This negotiation-based equilibrium can be reached both in the absence of relatedness and in a kin-structured population. However, when relatedness is high, evolution often ends up in an alternative equilibrium where subordinates help their kin unconditionally. The level of help at this kin-selected equilibrium is considerably lower than at the negotiation-based equilibrium, and it corresponds to a level reached when responsiveness is prevented from evolving in the simulations. A mathematical invasion analysis reveals that, quite generally, the alignment of payoffs due to the relatedness of interaction partners tends to impede selection for harsh but effective punishment of defectors. Hence kin structure will often hamper rather than facilitate the evolution of productive cooperation.},

The task presents a problem that cleaner fish often face in nature: choosing between two client types, one that is willing to wait for inspection and one that may leave if ignored. The cleaner's choice hence influences the future availability of clients (i.e., it influences food availability). We show that learning the preference that maximizes food intake requires subjects to represent in their memory different combinations of pairs of client types rather than just individual client types. In addition, subjects need to account for future consequences of actions, either by estimating expected long-term reward or by experiencing a client leaving as a penalty (negative reward). Finally, learning is influenced by the absolute and relative abundance of client types. Thus, cognitive mechanisms and ecological conditions jointly explain intra- and interspecific variation in the ability to learn the adaptive response.},

In this study I manipulated the size of the forehead patch, a sexually selected trait that functions as a badge of status in male collared flycatchers Ficedula albicollis). First, I found that a male's likelihood to establish a breeding territory with respect to his original badge size was affected by the treatment such that old males (older than or equal to two years) with relatively small original badges enjoyed an increased likelihood of establishing a breeding territory while young males (yearlings) suffered a reduced likelihood of establishment when their badges were enlarged as compared to unchanged. Second, young males with enlarged badges that were able to establish a territory fed their nestlings less in relation to their females compared to the control males. However, the females adjusted their parental effort to such an extent that no significant differences were observed in total feeding rate nor in reproductive success between the two groups of males. These results suggest that experimentally enlarged badge size in the collared flycatcher may result in increased male competition and that males have to trade their effort spent in male contest against their parental effort.},

  abstract = {1.The agonistic behavior of the funnel-web building spider, Agelenopsis aperta (Gertsch), was studied using induced encounters between adult females at natural web sites. All behavior exhibited by either individual during the course of an encounter was recorded. The results were analyzed through the use of transition matrices and the following multivariate treatments: factor analysis, ordination, and multiple regression. These latter methods were used to provide insight into possible sources of variability and their underlying causes.2.Sequence outcome is primarily determined by the relative weight of the two contestants engaged in a territorial dispute. If the size difference is large, the larger of the two individuals wins in a significant number of cases. Home bias is evidenced in cases where body weights are close.3.A stereotypy measure is devised that reflects the percent similarity of each sequence of events to an expected sequence (average). The frequency distribution, presence-absence or duration of all behavior patterns observed during the course of the disputes are utilized in measuring stereotypy. The territorial disputes of A. aperta exhibit low stereotypy, averaging 43\% on a scale from 0 to 100\%.4.Low stereotypy is, in part, related to the utilization of 33 different action patterns by spiders in these disputes. Factor analysis is used to express these action patterns in terms of five functional groups including locating behavior, signaling behavior, threat behavior, contact behavior, and a multiple function category. The order of these categories represents increasing cost based on relative estimates of the energy expenditure necessary to complete a specific behavior pattern and the potential for injury through the use of it.5.A Bray and Curtis ordination shows the important sources of between sequence variability to be the total energetic cost of the dispute and the complexity of behavior exhibited in it. The factors, in turn, depend on the resident-visitor status of the losing spider and on the relative size of the two contestants. The energetic cost of a dispute is markedly higher in those disputes in which the resident loses her territory. The number of action patterns and total frequency of acts observed are also greater in encounters in which the resident is the losing spider. Behavioral complexity is higher as well in cases where the weights of the two contestants are close.6.The variation in the pathways through which the sequences progress is shown to reflect the operation of assessment strategies by A. aperta. Initial assessment of the relative weights of the opponent is made through movements on the web at a distance (locating behavior). Subsequent activities depend on the results of this assessment, the predominant strategy being `retaliator' (Maynard Smith and Price, 1973) in which an individual responds to escalation with further escalation. Spiders with a large weight advantage over the opponent tend to escalate directly to threat and contact behavior (`hawk' strategy). The corresponding strategy for a much smaller visiting spider is immediate retreat (`mouse'). A much smaller resident spider, however, will exhibit the `retaliator' strategy to the `hawk' rather than the more conservative `mouse' strategy. The particular stategy exhibited, then, also depends on the energetic investment a particular individual has in the contended resource.7.Within functional group variability is shown to significantly affect the outcome of territorial disputes. Winning spiders exhibit an average of 20\% less stereotypy than losing spiders. Unpredictable behavior possibly confuses the opponent, causing it to make inaccurate assessments of the weights of the opponent relative to it. Retreat follows. This behavior is linked to the `protean displays' exhibited in defense against predators (Humphries and Driver, 1967).},

  abstract = {The significance of the placement of bird species along a winter-plumage-variability axis is hypothesized to be causally related to the social system through which access to resources is controlled. When individuals compete for resources through territorial systems a single plumage type should be advantageous; when individuals compete through dominance behavior, variations in plumage which serve to signal dominance status are increasingly advantageous as flock stability declines. The following predictions from this theory were confirmed: (1) Winter flocking species are more variable than winter territorial species. (2) Three measures of flock stability (migratory status, nocturnal versus diurnal migrants, and frequency of distress screams) all showed plumage variability to be greater when the stability of individual memberships in flocks was lower. (3) Individual plumage differences signal dominance status in Harris sparrows. A further prediction that individuals similar in appearance would fight more than very different individuals was not confirmed in Harris sparrows. This prediction was based on two important assumptions: (1) that observed fights were within flocks and (2) that disputes were over position in the hierarchy. A flock cluster analysis served to eliminate the potential difficulty of assumption (1), and the prediction that individuals more alike in appearance should fight most was then strongly rejected. This implied that assumption (2) was not valid. Examination of this assumption showed fighting to be despotic; that is, top dominants concentrate their attacks on the lowest birds which are least likely to fight back. Such a pattern of fighting should give the top dominants the greatest gain in resources for lowest risk and least energy invested in defense of resources. This despotic pattern of fighting contrasts sharply with that reported for mountain sheep where the defensible resource conferring fitness-access to estrus ewes-requires only a stable hierarchy and not the exclusion of subordinates.},

  abstract = {The social intelligence hypothesis argues that competition and cooperation among individuals have shaped the evolution of cognition in animals. What do we mean by social cognition? Here we suggest that the building blocks of social cognition are a suite of skills, ordered roughly according to the cognitive demands they place upon individuals. These skills allow an animal to recognize others by various means; to recognize and remember other animals' relationships; and, perhaps, to attribute mental states to them. Some skills are elementary and virtually ubiquitous in the animal kingdom; others are more limited in their taxonomic distribution. We treat these skills as the targets of selection, and assume that more complex levels of social cognition evolve only when simpler methods are inadequate. As a result, more complex levels of social cognition indicate greater selective pressures in the past. The presence of each skill can be tested directly through field observations and experiments. In addition, the same methods that have been used to compare social cognition across species can also be used to measure individual differences within species and to test the hypothesis that individual differences in social cognition are linked to differences in reproductive success.},

  abstract = {A wide range of complex social behaviors are facilitated by the recognition of individual conspecifics. Individual recognition requires sufficient phenotypic variation to provide identity information as well as receivers that process and respond to identity information. Understanding how a complex trait such as individual recognition evolves requires that we consider how each component has evolved. Previous comparative studies have examined phenotypic variability in senders and receiver learning abilities, although little work has compared receiver responses to identity information among related species with and without individual recognition. Here, we compare responses to identity information in two Polistes paper wasps: P. fuscatus, which visually recognizes individuals, and P. metricus, which does not normally show evidence of individual recognition. Although the species differ in individual recognition, the results of this study show that receiver responses to experimentally manipulated identity information are surprisingly similar in both species. Receivers direct less aggression toward identifiable individuals than unidentifiable individuals. Therefore, the responses necessary for individual recognition may pre-date its evolution in the P. fuscatus lineage. Additionally, our data demonstrate the apparent binary differences in a complex behavior between the two species, such as individual recognition, likely involve incremental differences along a number of axes.},

Individual recognition requires sufficient cognitive abilities and phenotypic diversity within a population for discrimination to be possible. Despite the importance of facial recognition in humans, the evolution of facial identity has received little attention. Here we demonstrate that faces evolved to signal individual identity under negative frequency-dependent selection. Faces show elevated phenotypic variation and lower between-trait correlations compared with other traits. Regions surrounding face-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms show elevated diversity consistent with frequency-dependent selection. Genetic variation maintained by identity signalling tends to be shared across populations and, for some loci, predates the origin of Homo sapiens. Studies of human social evolution tend to emphasize cognitive adaptations, but we show that social evolution has shaped patterns of human phenotypic and genetic diversity as well.},

What is the current status of Darwin's claim that other species share the same "mental powers" as humans, but to different degrees? In this completely revised second edition of Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior, Sara Shettleworth addresses these questions, among others, by integrating findings from psychology, behavioral ecology, and ethology in a unique and wide-ranging synthesis of theory and research on animal cognition, in the broadest sense--from species-specific adaptations of vision in fish and associative learning in rats to discussions of theory of mind in chimpanzees, dogs, and ravens. She reviews the latest research on topics such as episodic memory, metacognition, and cooperation and other-regarding behavior in animals, as well as recent theories about what makes human cognition unique. In every part of this new edition, Shettleworth incorporates findings and theoretical approaches that have emerged since the first edition was published in 1998. The chapters are now organized into three sections: Fundamental Mechanisms (perception, learning, categorization, memory), Physical Cognition (space, time, number, physical causation), and Social Cognition (social knowledge, social learning, communication). Shettleworth has also added new chapters on evolution and the brain and on numerical cognition, and a new chapter on physical causation that integrates theories of instrumental behavior with discussions of foraging, planning, and tool using.},

  abstract = {Honest signalling assumes a correlation between an observable signal and a nonobservable quality. There are many mutually nonexclusive mechanisms that can achieve such a correlation; however, for a long time the handicap principle has been identified as the main solution to this problem. In short, it claims that signals need to be costly to be honest and that honest signallers have to pay this extra cost at the equilibrium (i.e. signals have to be handicaps). Honesty, however, is not maintained by the realized cost paid by honest signallers at the equilibrium but by the potential cost of cheating. Whether this potential cost implies a realized cost for honest signallers depends on the biological details of the system and thus this cost cannot be predicted a priori without knowledge of these details. Accordingly, depending on these details, signals need not be costly to be honest, even under conflict of interest. In other words, handicapping equilibrium signals are not the only way to create a high potential cost of cheating. Here I first review the theoretical models supporting the above conclusion, and then I list mechanisms that can maintain a high potential cost of cheating without imposing extra realized cost (i.e. a handicap) on honest signallers at the equilibrium. Identifying and describing those constraints or the lack of them that might create a connection between these two types of cost should be a major research agenda.},

  abstract = {Many species of birds show distinctive seasonal breeding and nonbreeding plumages. A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the evolution of this seasonal dichromatism, specifically related to the idea that birds may experience variable levels of sexual selection relative to natural selection throughout the year. However, these hypotheses have not addressed the selective forces that have shaped molt, the underlying mechanism of plumage change. Here, we examined relationships between life-history variation, the evolution of a seasonal molt, and seasonal plumage dichromatism in the New World warblers (Aves: Parulidae), a family with a remarkable diversity of plumage, molt, and life-history strategies. We used phylogenetic comparative methods and path analysis to understand how and why distinctive breeding and nonbreeding plumages evolve in this family. We found that color change alone poorly explains the evolution of patterns of biannual molt evolution in warblers. Instead, molt evolution is better explained by a combination of other life-history factors, especially migration distance and foraging stratum. We found that the evolution of biannual molt and seasonal dichromatism is decoupled, with a biannual molt appearing earlier on the tree, more dispersed across taxa and body regions, and correlating with separate life-history factors than seasonal dichromatism. This result helps explain the apparent paradox of birds that molt biannually but show breeding plumages that are identical to the nonbreeding plumage. We find support for a two-step process for the evolution of distinctive breeding and nonbreeding plumages: That prealternate molt evolves primarily under selection for feather renewal, with seasonal color change sometimes following later. These results reveal how life-history strategies and a birds' environment act upon multiple and separate feather functions to drive the evolution of feather replacement patterns and bird coloration.},

Here, we applied a comparative analysis to test factors associated with the origin and maintenance of black chest and throat patches, which in some taxa are referred to as `badges-of-status'. Specifically, we tested whether the evolution of black colour patches in Old and New World sparrows is consistent with a signalling function during the nonbreeding season or breeding season. We found no positive associations between patch evolution and polygyny or summer sociality. Instead, patch evolution is significantly associated with sociality during the nonbreeding season. Additionally, unlike typical plumage characteristics under sexual selection, these patches are visible throughout the nonbreeding season. Further, the pattern of patch dimorphism uncovered in this study does not match expectations for a trait that evolved in a reproductive context. In particular, patch dimorphism is not associated with polygyny or the presence of extra-pair mating although other types of plumage dimorphism are strongly associated with nonmonogamous mating systems. Overall, patterns of patch evolution suggest that they are more strongly associated with social competition during the nonbreeding season than sexual competition during the breeding season. These results clarify why some previous work has uncovered puzzling relationships between black plumage patches and reproductive behaviour. We discuss these findings in the context of signal theory and previous work on badges-of-status.},

However, relatively little research has explored the other half of the communication equation: the individual being recognized (signaler). Provided there is a benefit to being accurately identified, signalers are expected to actively broadcast their identity with distinctive cues. Considering the prevalence of IR, there are probably widespread benefits associated with distinctiveness.

In general, signals of quality require high and differential costs to remain honest1,2 (that is, prevent low-quality cheaters from exploiting any fitness benefits associated with communicating high quality). The theoretically required costs for badges of status remain controversial because the development (or `production') of such signals often seems to be relatively cost-free5,6,8. One important hypothesis is that such signals impose social (or `maintenance') costs incurred through repeated agonistic interactions with other individuals9,10,11,12. However, convincing empirical evidence for social costs remains elusive6,7. Here we report social costs in a previously undescribed badge of status: the highly variable black facial patterns of female paper wasps, Polistes dominulus. Facial patterns strongly predict body size and social dominance. Moreover, in staged contests between pairs of unfamiliar wasps, subordinate wasps with experimentally altered facial features (`cheaters') received considerably more aggression from the dominant than did sham controls, indicating that facial patterns are signals and that dishonest signalling imposes social costs.},

We find wasps that signal inaccurately high fighting ability receive more aggression than controls and receiving aggression reduces juvenile hormone (JH) titers. As a result, immediately after contests, inaccurate signalers have lower JH titers than controls. Ornaments also directly influence rival JH titers. Three hours after contests, wasps who interacted with rivals signaling high fighting ability have higher JH titers than wasps who interacted with rivals signaling low fighting ability. Therefore, ornaments influence hormone titers of both signalers and receivers. We demonstrate that relationships between hormones and ornaments are flexible and bidirectional rather than static and unidirectional. Dynamic relationships among ornaments, behavior, and physiology may be an important, but overlooked factor in the evolution of honest communication.},

  abstract = {Many animals minimize the costs of conflict by using social eavesdropping to learn about the fighting ability of potential rivals before they interact. Learning about individual conspecifics via social eavesdropping allows individuals to assess potential opponents without personal risk. However, keeping track of a network of individually differentiated social relationships is thought to be cognitively challenging. Here, we test how Polistes fuscatus nest-founding queens use social eavesdropping to assess individual rivals. Bystanders watched conspecifics fight through a clear partition. Then, bystanders were allowed to interact with fighters. Bystander behavior toward fighters was strongly influenced by the observed fight; bystanders were less aggressive toward fighters that were seen to initiate more and receive less aggression. Control trials allow us to reject alternative explanations for the link between observed aggression and bystander behavior, including priming or winner/loser effects. Therefore, P. fuscatus wasps observe and remember a complex network of social interactions between individual conspecifics rather than only paying attention to individuals they interact with directly. Wasps have an impressive capacity to learn, remember, and make social deductions about individuals. These results indicate that insects can have surprisingly complex social lives involving a network of individually differentiated social relationships.},

  abstract = {The turnstone Arenaria interpres has marked plumage variability in comparison with many other waders (shorebirds). Two hypotheses were tested in an attempt to explain plumage variability in breeding turnstones. The first, the status signalling hypothesis (SSH), suggests that plumage type signals status, and the second, the individual recognition hypothesis (IRH), suggests that plumage differences enable territorial birds to be recognized by their neighbours. The SSH was rejected by two tests: (a) there was no correlation between plumage phenotype of males and the quality of the territories they occupied; and (b) there was no correlation between the plumage phenotype of males and females paired to each other (assuming assortative mating according to rank). The IRH was supported by a test which showed that males could discriminate between neighbours and strangers on plumage differences alone: fibre-glass models mimicking neighbours were effectively ignored whilst models mimicking strangers elicited an aggressive response. It is stressed that this result does not demonstrate that plumage variability in breeding turnstones evolved to facilitate recognition by neighbours, and the potential of the IRH as an explanation of breeding plumage variability in waders is discussed.},

  abstract = {Cultural evolution can result in changes in the prevalence not only of different learned song types within bird populations but also of different segments within the song. Between 1980 and 2011, we examined changes within different segments of the single songs of male Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichiensis, in an island population. Introductory notes did not change. The buzz segment showed similar stability; although a rare low-frequency variant appeared and then disappeared, the buzz segments from 1980 and 2011 were essentially identical. The middle segment, made up of discrete notes assembled into several types, was variable. However, the form of the middle segment did not affect fitness and may serve to denote individual identity. The terminal trill decreased steadily in frequency and duration over three decades. Longer trills were associated with lower reproductive success, suggesting that trill duration was under sexual selection. The notes sung between introductory notes were also associated with reproductive success. A high cluster sung in 1980\textendash 1982 disappeared altogether by 2011, and was gradually replaced by click trains, which were associated with greater reproductive success. During the final decade of the study, more clicks were added to click trains. Longer click trains, which may require vocal virtuosity and so indicate male quality, were also associated with greater reproductive success. Both trill duration and the number of clicks increased in variance during the three-decade span of the study. We suggest that such increases in variance might be a signature of directional cultural selection. Within the Savannah sparrow's relatively short and simple learned song, cultural evolution appears to be mediated by different mechanisms for different song segments, perhaps because the segments convey different information.},

It involves the production and propagation of individually-distinctive signals or cues and then the perception and recognition of those signals or cues. This review highlights recent work investigating this process, emphasizing the cognitive basis of perception and recognition. It finds that relatively few studies have addressed how signatures propagate through the environment and are processed by the receiver. Given variation across species in the complexity of recognition, this review recommends further comparative studies be conducted to unravel the factors underlying this variation.},

These handicaps are of use to the selecting sex since they test the quality of the mate. The size of characters selected in this way serve as marks of quality. The understanding that a handicap, which tests for quality, can evolve as a consequence of its advantage to the individual, may provide an explanation for many puzzling evolutionary problems. Such an interpretation may provide an alternative to other hypotheses which assumed complicated selective mechanisms, such as group selection or kin selection, which do not act directly on the individual.},
